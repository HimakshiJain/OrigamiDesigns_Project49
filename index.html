            Step 7) Fold and Unfold the sides and the top along the dotted lines. You’ll use these creases in the next step.<br>
            
            Step 8) Open up the top layer of paper and fold it up using the crease from the previous step.<br>
            
            Step 9) Fold in both sides along the existing creases making a Petal Fold.<br>
            
            Step 10) Turn the paper over.<br>
            
            Step 11) Repeat steps 7-9 on this side.<br>
            
            Step 12) Fold both sides to the centre along the dotted lines. Then repeat on the other side.<br>
            
            Step 13) Inside Reverse Fold up both sides of the paper just like in a paper crane.<br>
            
            Step 14) Reverse Fold the back part down to make the back legs.<br>
            
            Step 15) Fold the top flap of paper down and repeat on the other side to make the front legs.<br>
            
            Step 16) Reverse Fold the tip down to make the head.<br>
            
            Step 17) Inside Reverse Fold the tip of the head.<br>
            
            Step 18) Fold the back of the leg inside the model along the dotted line. Repeat on the other side.<br>
